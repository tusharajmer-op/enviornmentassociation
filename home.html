The EAB conducts various activities on a regular basis, our focus areas include:<br><br>

<div class="content_sub">Seminars and workshops​</div>
EAB has been active in organizing seminars, workshops, conferences and policy discussions. While some events have had an international flavor with participation of experts from the Water Environmental Federation, USA and also from other organizations and countries, other seminars have had a national flavor with participation from Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and New Delhi. Apart from these participants, there are always participants representing various stakeholders in Bangalore and other parts of Karnataka State.
<br><br>
<div class="content_sub">Know-how for restoration of lakes</div>
​EAB has been called upon to give technical guidance for treating the wastewater that flows into virtually every lake in Bangalore. Detailed technical designs have been given for lakes, such as Vasanthapura, Hebbal, Madivala, Bellandur, etc. The solutions have been accepted and the implementation has confirmed that the solutions were the best. In fact, an expert and member of EAB has also offered technical guidance in respect of some lakes in Hyderabad, like the Hussainsagar lake also. It is a matter of great pride that this expert and member of EAB is associated with Amaravathi, the new Capital of Andhra Pradesh.
<br><br>
    <div class="content_sub">School and College programmes</div>
EAB has been trying to inculcate in the students of some school and college, awareness and concern about the environment. To this end, talks, demonstrations and local field-visits have been organized for children of UAS Campus School, Sri Jnanakshi Vidyaniketan, Sri Ramana Maharshi Academy for the Blind, and Sri Kumarans Childrens' Home during the year, 2003.
<br><br>
<div class="content_sub">Project Formulation</div>
EAB has also undertaken project formulation on the request of certain agencies of Government. These project reports, which have been prepared in a highly professional manner, have, subsequently, been posed to international funding agencies.
<br><br>
<div class="content_sub">Participation in Seminars/Conferences</div>
In view of the great expertise that some members of EAB possess, invitations are received, regularly, seeking, participation of EAB at international and national seminars, both in India and abroad, on various aspects of environment. EAB has ensured that members attend at least some of these seminars and share their knowledge and experience with the other participants.​
